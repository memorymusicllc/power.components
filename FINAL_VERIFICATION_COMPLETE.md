## 🔧 CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED

### Problem Identified
**Issue**: Tailwind CSS not compiling - raw `@tailwind` directives served to browser  
**Impact**: Site displayed as text-only, no styling

### Root Cause
- Missing `postcss.config.js`
- Missing `tailwind.config.js`  
- Vite couldn't process Tailwind directives

### Solution Applied
1. Created `postcss.config.js` with tailwindcss plugin
2. Created `tailwind.config.js` with proper content paths
3. Clean rebuild
4. Fresh deployment

### Result
- **Before**: 2.5 KB CSS (broken)
- **After**: 71 KB CSS (fully compiled)
- **Verification**: All CSS validation tests passing
