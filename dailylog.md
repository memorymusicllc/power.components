| x | done | Fix blank page by using relative Vite base and rebuild | 2025-10-11 | 2025-10-11 |

## 2025-10-11
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to set `base: './'` so built HTML references assets relatively. This fixes blank page when served from subpaths (e.g., Cloudflare Pages) where absolute `/assets/...` fails.
- Clean reinstalled dependencies to resolve Rollup optional native dependency resolution error on Linux.
- Rebuilt `dist/`; verified `dist/index.html` now uses `./assets/...` URLs.
- Forced add select `dist` artifacts for deployment.
- Commit created on branch `cursor/debug-no-visible-page-components-06ab`.

Issues:
- `vite preview` couldn't run in CI shell session here. Manual verification of built HTML confirms relative asset fix.

In progress / Next:
- Ensure deployment picks up new `dist`.
