## 📋 Next Steps

### Required: Configure GitHub Secrets

Before the automated deployment will work, you need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN**
   - See `.github/SETUP_SECRETS.md` for instructions

2. **CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID**
   - See `.github/SETUP_SECRETS.md` for instructions

### Steps to Configure:

1. Go to: https://github.com/make-sum/pow3r-cashout/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add both secrets as documented in `.github/SETUP_SECRETS.md`

### Verify Deployment:

Once secrets are configured:

1. The next push to `main` will trigger automatic deployment
2. Monitor progress at: https://github.com/make-sum/pow3r-cashout/actions
3. View deployment at Cloudflare Pages dashboard
4. E2E tests will run automatically after deployment
